	<h1>His personal life and information</h1>
<p>Taurus Tremani Bartlett (born January 6, 1999), nown professionaly as Polo G, is an American rapper. He rose to prominence with his singles"Finer Things".Polo G is a versatile rapper who has achieved several multi-platinum albums and singles. He spent time in Chicago's correctional facilities before getting a major-label contract and viral hits. Still in his late teens, the rapper left jail and began releasing tracks and videos while still unsigned and without management. The video for his insparational and melodic song "Finer Things" was viewed tens of millions of times and helped his 2019 debut LP, Die a Legend, cracked the Top Ten on the Billboard 200. His subsequent albums fared even better, with 2020's The Goat debuting at number one. He also hit the top 40 of the Hot 100 with 2022's "Distraction." His fourth studio album, Hood Poet, appeared in 2023.</p>
<p>Raised in the rough Cabrini-Green neighborhood of northern Chicago, Polo G was rapping by the time he was a teenager. His earliest songs appeared online in 2017, but it wasn't until his breakout single, "Finer Things," that things really started to take off. The motivational song was written when Polo was incarcerated, and once he was free, he recorded it and made an accompanying video, which immediately caught the attention of millions. Things moved quickly from there, as a record contract with Columbia Records soon followed, and more singles were released to similar excitement. In 2018, Polo G issued songs like "Hollywood" and "Gang with Me," and he began 2019 with the release of "Pop Out," a collaboration with Lil Tjay. The song cracked the Billboard single chart, peaking at number 28. </p>
<p>Sometimes leaning more into drill styles and sometimes tending toward more sung R&B, Polo G's approach has shifted from song to song. The spare and melancholy "Battle Cry" single appeared next, and in June 2019, his debut full-length, Die a Legend, arrived on Columbia Records. The album was well-received both critically and commercially, cracking the charts and collecting glowing press. He released a new single, "Inspiration," within a month of his LP coming out. Second studio album The Goat was issued in May 2020 and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200. The record included guest spots from rappers like Lil Baby, Stunna 4 Vegas, and Juice WRLD as well as production on highlight tracks from Mustard and Mike WiLL Made-It.</p>
